			</header>

			<p>Using DLM, CrypKey can encrypt virtually any Windows file including Video/Audio (AVI, WMV, MP3's, WAV, etc.).</p>

			<p>Once encrypted, the protected material is licensed to end users effectively preventing unauthorized use.</p>
			<p>However, unlike other products, DLM protects the actual files or intellectual property associated with a player, and not just the player of the media itself.  The DLM can also handle multiple types of files within the same product. For example, Video, PPT, and PDF files used in the same flash project can all be protected. The DLM approach does not  involve trying to lump all files into one exe - instead, each file needing protection is encrypted individually, resulting in a faster, more reliable and robust system.</p>
			<p>As well, other methods on the market can distort the way your content or property is played back post protection. This is NOT the case with CrypKey DLM as it has no effect on playback. The protected material remains encrypted at all times except when decrypted on the fly in memory by CrypKey during playback or viewing. </p>
			<p>At <strong>no</strong> time is it vulnerable to unauthorized users.</p>

				<h2 id="#cloud-licensing">CrypKey Software Licensing in the Cloud - Software Copy Protection - Now With More Flexibility!</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Prior to our latest TCPIP model, CrypKey's software copy protection used NETBIOS to control the communications between Client Applications and Server Licenses. Communications were limited to having both the License Server and the Client on a Physical Machine within your network.</p>

			<p>Driven by vendors such as Amazon, software license models 'In the Cloud' are often pay-as-you-go and/or subscription-based licenses. The best known example is 'Salesforce.com' which is licensed according to the number of users and based on subscriptions. This model only works well for a fully integrated service or when replacing an existing or (on premise) software solution.</p>
			<p>CrypKey - <strong>(now completely loaded with the addition of TCPIP Based Licenses!)</strong> - can support the flexibility of having a client application installed anywhere and on any Window OS based machine! If the client machine is connected to the internet and configured to look to the Static IP for the License Server, the software will accept the license and run!</p>

			<p>You may also limit the License Server to as many (or as few) licenses/concurrent users as you wish.  Remaining clients configured to look to the license server for an operating license will have to wait in queue until a license becomes available, or in turn, purchase more license seats.  </p>
			<p>As a CrypKey user, you also have the option to put your application 'In the Cloud' if you have a designated cloud server with a full Operating System installed.  Now, your users can remotely log in and remotely use the client application in the cloud!  Specifically, this client application would have to be configured to look to a licensed server that has Static Hardware and a Static IP.  Again, the license server could be configured to as many or as few licenses/concurrent users as you wish.  The remainder of clients configured to look to the license server would similarly have to wait in a queue until another license becomes available. Furthermore, the license server could be disabled at any time, thereby resulting in the restriction of everyone else's access to receiving a valid license.</p>
			<p>Unlike the previous NETBIOS version, and with the current TCPIP version, the client and or server are not limited to being housed on the same network.  The IP's can exist anywhere on the internet thus making this feature a great tool in your CrypKey Software Copy Protection Licensing Solution!</p>

			<h3><a href="vmprotect.html" target="_blank">VMProtect</a></h3>
			<p>CrypKey now provides an effective solution for virtual machines. As virtual machines become more common, they expose a major flaw in many copy protection systems. Illegal copying of applications becomes easy in a virtual machine environment since machine information such as drive serial number, motherboard serial number, ect, are duplicated exactly on a virtual machine. This means copy protection software often fails to detect the presence of the virtual machine, and your software could be compromised. CrypKey <a href="vmprotect.html" target="_blank">VM Protect</a> ensures your application is safe and fully protected from this problem. Because VM Protect reads real hardware information, CrypKey software can easily detect the presence of a virtual machine and thus continue to protect your application from illegal copying.</p>

			<p><a href="vmprotect.html" target="_blank">CrypKey VM Protect</a> is available for both <a href="instant.html" target="_blank">INSTANT</a> and <a href="sdk.html"  target="_blank">SDK</a>. Upgrade to V8.X to ensure you are protected against virtual machine duplication. CrypKey 8.X with VM Protect can be added to existing licenses without any interruptions.</p>

			<h3>Microsoft Windows 8 and 8.1 Support</h3>
			<p>CrypKey now assures full compatibility with all relevant products on Windows 8 and 8.1. Because of changes to the way applications and drivers are handled in Windows 8, SDK and INSTANT have been thoroughly tested on Windows 8 to fix any potential problems. With V8.X, CrypKey products will run smoothly on any Windows 8 system.</p>

			<h3>TCPIP Network Licensing – (SDK only)</h3>
			<p>CrypKey SDK now supports TCP/IP enterprise network licensing in addition to the Netbios method. TCPIP is used in situations where the network configuration does not work with the current Net-bios communication default. Beta testers of TCP/IP have found it is faster, easier, and more robust to use.</p>

			<p>Switch easily to this new method in V8, and customize with useful configuration options. For current customers, use of TCP/IP is as simple as clicking "Enable TCP/IP" on your current configuration.</p>

				<h2 id="the-cloud">Software Licensing in the Cloud</h2>
			</header>

			<p>"Cloud" and "cloud computing" have become part of our reality and IT jargon. In very simple terms, the Internet is now the cloud. This means that accessing required data and programs can be done through and from the Internet - not from a hard drive on your computer or your local network. Therefore, as software moves to and from the cloud to the end user, licensing of this software can also be managed over the cloud.</p>

			<h3>Advantages of cloud-based licensing:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> is the first and foremost advantage. Having Internet access is all that is required to access the license for your software products.</li>
				<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> allows delivery of the software license anywhere in the world. Reactivation, renewal or acquisition of a different license can be done on the fly anywhere in the world.</li>
				<li><strong>Control</strong> by the license administrator is unparalleled. As both software and license may originate/reside in the cloud, control over the license is much more robust. Licenses can be easily revoked, customized or renewed with almost instantaneous results.</li>
				<li><strong>Co-operation</strong> is possible as modules, plug-ins and virtual partners for software can be accessed, and licenses for those components can be activated. This creates possible synergy and business opportunities between software developers.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>As more software is served from the cloud and - in many instances, only from the cloud - the strength of the licensing scheme for that software is crucial. The end user must have a high level of accessibility and flexibility to their licensed software. The software developer/distributor benefits from the control and opportunity to gainfully co-operate with other developers/distributors. Because of this, the "cloud" is becoming more than just IT jargon. It is the future of software licensing and management.</p>

			<p>CrypKey version 8.0 facilitates cloud licensing through its robust TCP/IP based libraries and utilities. To find out more about these features contact:</p>

				<h2 id="hack-risk">What is the risk level of my software being hacked?</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Software is a form of intellectual property. As such, if the software is of value, it may be susceptible to theft, hacking and/or illegal use. Hence, it is crucial that part of your software development plan be devoted to strategies which deter or mitigate illegal use of software. The degree to which you implement protective measures will generally depend upon the software's actual or perceived level of risk.</p>

			<h3>Before talking about risk levels, let's first define the types of breeches as it pertains to software.</h3>

			<p>Illegal use of software typically takes one of the following forms (or combinations thereof):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reverse engineering</li>
				<li>Duplication and/or illegal distribution/sales</li>
				<li>Use by unauthorized or unlicensed users</li>
				<li>Use of unauthorized or unlicensed copies</li>
			</ol>

			<p>The level of risk will be determined by the relationship between the intrinsic value of your software and the nature of the market in which your software is sold/available.</p>

			<h3>Here are two risk scenarios at the extremes:</h3>

			<ol>
				<li>Highest risk - the software has high value and/or a high sales volume in a marketplace that offers little or no legal protection for intellectual property</li>
				<li>Lowest risk - the software has low value and/or a low sales volume in a marketplace that offers established enforcement of intellectual property rights</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Some risk scenarios to consider:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Emerging markets offer opportunity - and higher risk</li>
				<li>Higher sales volume increases value - and risk</li>
				<li>Highly sought after software carries an increased level of risk</li>
				<li>No software which strives for (or is expected to have) a high value and/or high sales volume should enter the marketplace unprotected</li>
				<li>Hackers operating in high risk markets often do not recognize or respect geographic or legal boundaries, even stealing software from markets with established intellectual property rights with little or no recourse</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Protecting your intellectual properties in any marketplace ensures your software maintains its value while (ideally) gaining sales. This strategy promotes the longevity of your software - and your company.<strong></p>

				<h2 id="model-primer">Software Licensing Models - A Primer</h2>
			</header>

			<p>In an effort to protect and control software distribution, several distinct software licensing models have been developed. Each model has a unique way of granting the authorized end user access to the licensed software. Most of the license models being used today fall under one of the following three categories.</p>

			<h3>Node-locked license</h3>
			<p>This is one of the most common license models in use today, sometimes referred to as an "individual computer license" where, in effect, the license is "locked" to the authorized computer. This model provides a specific license for a stand-alone computer with the license locked to the hardware on that PC. The software must be individually installed, with the license being authorized on each device. The activation of this license may require Internet or an exchange of encrypted keys.</p>

			<p>This license model works well when delivering software to individual customers with one, or only a few, devices or to customers where they prefer to license each stand-alone computer separately.</p>

			<h3>Network license</h3>
			<p>The advantage of the network license over a node-locked license is that license authorization is deployed from a server, giving the network administrator a more efficient way to manage software licensing. Network licensing controls the number of "concurrent users" that can use the software in a company. More complex network licensing can involve having named users or having different numbers of users for different modules in the software.</p>

			<p>This license is preferred by companies who want to share a pool of licenses or who want a more centralized method of licensing software.</p>

			<h3>USB key and dongle based license</h3>
			<p>USB key and dongle licensing both provide a mechanism to lock the use of the software to a physical device plugged into the computer. In order to use the desired software, a matching and licensed USB key or dongle must be connected to the computer. Consequently, when the USB key or dongle is removed from the computer, so is the license authorization for that particular software.</p>

			<p>This model has the advantage of easy portability between computers. Several computers can have the software installed but only the one with the USB key or dongle plugged in will open the software.</p>

			<h3>Going hand-in-hand: the end user experience and security</h3>
			The above three licensing models provide effective means of delivering licensed software to authorized users while preventing incidences of unauthorized use. Software developers and distributors must evaluate their needs in respect to the environment in which their software will be deployed. The right choice will enable a secure and friendly end user experience.

				<h2 id="protect-malicious">Top 6 Tips to Protect Your Computer from Malicious Software</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Computer users have to be very careful with various security threats on daily basis. These various threats that can damage your system, software and data files can disrupt internet traffic and also allow unauthorized access to your system, which may result in loss of confidential information. As a PC user, you need to be very careful while dealing with computer viruses, hackers and spyware, and learn how to protect your computer from malicious software.</p>

			<h3>How Does Computer Virus Spread and How to Protect Your Data?</h3>

			<p>The increasing email services, instant messages and file sharing has given way to various viruses, worms and Trojan horses. Unlike computer viruses, computer worms do not need a host program to run. It has the capability of replicating itself automatically. However, Trojan does not replicate; instead, it pretends to work as some decent program when downloaded. Hackers use authorized access to reach your computer; they use the back door to your PC created by some other malware. Spyware tends to get downloaded via websites, email and other sorts of instant messages; this basically happens while accepting an End User License Agreement. These viruses raise the security threats for a computer whereas there are few tips that could explain how to protect data.</p>

			<h3>How Can the Data Be Protected?</h3>

			<p>Wondering how to protect your data? Following 6 steps will go a long way in ensuring enhanced safety of your data -</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Make sure you install antivirus and anti-spyware programs in your computer. Never run any free downloads until you have researched about the software developer. Few downloads are sometimes a malware that breaches your computer security.</li>
				<li>You should install the security programs that offer real time and active protection. Some of the free antivirus programs can detect only the viruses that have already infected your PC.</li>
				<li>Keep your Internet security up-to-date. New viruses come out every other day and they can be fought only with updated and latest database and security programs.</li>
				<li>Always consider installing a firewall program and configure it in a way that it blocks any unauthorized access to your computer. It should restrict any sort of uncertified inbound and outbound transactions and communications. This can protect your PC from hackers and restrict loss of any confidential information.</li>
				<li>Make sure you delete all spam messages and install a spam filter. A spam message contains some links that lands on fake and misleading sites where your personal data can be stolen, which is termed as phishing.</li>
				<br>
				Spam messages are also a way to spread viruses and spyware. Hence, you must never open or click on the links in spam messages.</li>
				<li>You have to be careful with your email attachments. Never open any unexpected and unknown email attachments as they might contain links, which can spread virus and spyware. Also make sure to change your passwords frequently. Never keep the same password for many sites as this might ease the hacker's task.
				<br>
				Keep a combination of letters, numbers and alphanumeric characters as your password. These basic things can go a long way in protecting your computer from malicious software.</li>

			</header>

			<h3>Software licensing service</h3>

			<p>A software licensing service is a suite of bundled software that protects the software and programs that are developed by coders or developers. This software license allows a developer to track the performance of his software, to protect is from piracy and even create new versions of it under the same license. The main aim is to maintain the integrity of the software and protect it from intellectual property theft.</p>

			<h3>Why do developers use software licensing services?</h3>

			<p>With so much rivalry in the development market these days' developers are facing stiff competition. So in order for their idea, code and concept to remain theirs alone they need to protect the code or the software that they create. They do not just want to protect it but even track its sales and see how it is doing in the current market. In order to do that they turn to software licensing services. Sure there is a major player in the market who markets this kind of licensing. However, there are other ways to figure out how to protect your software from piracy. There could be several reasons why developers turn to these kinds of licenses, let's take a look at a few of those:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Security:</strong><br>
				This is most crucial reason developers use these software licenses - to protect their software. This is done to prevent any other person to actually steal their software or pirate it and call it their own.</li>
				<li><strong>Simple to use:</strong><br>
				The developers can easily use this licensing software to define the amount they want to charges their end users. This can be made flexible easily as the factors for the price of the software could be dependent on currency, demographics, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>Filtering customers:</strong><br>
				If you are wondering how software protection licensing works when talking about the end user then there are plenty of user who are looking to free load of a software. They are constantly looking for pirate versions of software so that they escape paying for it. This is why it is essential for developers to actually keep a watchful eye out for such users. At the same, they have to take extra care and ensure not to ruin the experience for users who are paying to use their software.</li>
				<li><strong>The price is right:</strong><br>
				Developers do not put too much thought into the amount they actually end up paying for protecting their software. To them the privacy of their software is of utmost importance. They do not mind paying exorbitant prices to protect their software.</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>Get more than just a software protection license</h3>

			<p>With so many companies now offering up their software protection licenses it becomes difficult to decide which one you can count on. So it is always good to do your research and check which licensing offers what and always read the fine print and read the reviews. How to protect your software from piracy should be your most crucial concern but along with that see if you can get more out of the software protection license. Here are a couple of things that this licensing software may offer along with protection:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A simple yet customizable user interface and encryption</li>

				<h2 id="data-encryption">What Is Data Encryption and Why Is It Needed Over Public Networks?</h2>
			</header>

			<h3>What Is Data Encryption and Why Is It Needed Over Public Networks?</h3>

			<p>In the present scenario, most of our personal and financial transactions are processed over internet. And there has to be a way to safeguard our information while it's being processed over internet and that way is encryption.</p>

			<h3>What Is Data Encryption and How Can Data Be Protected?</h3>

			<p>The conversion of data into a secret and unique code is termed as encryption. It is the most effective and efficient way to achieve data security. The various queries on how to protect data over internet can be answered through encryption. To access and read an encrypted file, one must have a secret key that acts as a password and can help you decrypt the file. It is a domain of network security that helps in hiding the sensitive data while it is processing on the network.</p>

			<h3>The Need for Data Encryption</h3>

			<p>Many computer users have the same question: what is data security? And this is the main query that could explain the importance of encryption. It is needed to handle the information transmission on the internet and keeping the data secure. Keeping all your personal and financial data intact on a personal computer is not an easy job. The information you send over internet can be viewed by anyone who wishes to see it.</p>

			<h3>How is it Routed?</h3>

			<p>The data you send travels through various paths. Firstly, it reaches your local network and it is the very same network that is used by people from your area. The information or data then travels to the ISP (Internet Service Provider), which has the capability to view this information easily and without much effort. The data then passes through various routes to reach its destination, which is the Internet Service Provider of the party that is supposed to receive the information you just sent. And, finally after all the hard work, the information you sent reaches the specified receiver. During this transmission, various people could have obtained access to your information and that is the reason you need to know how to protect data through encryption.</p>

			<h3>Virus Infections</h3>

			<p>You might have a assurance that your computer is safe and secure with the route operating for you, but you are unaware of the fact that your laptop, computer or any other devices that are working with your home network can be affected by virus the minute a virus-affected third party device connects and plugs in to your network.</p>

			<h3>Internet Security Issues</h3>

			<p>The Internet services extended by hotels and coffee shops are not as safe as they seem. This is another reason that emphasizes the need for encryption. These internet systems have the capacity to protect the customers and their internet communications from the outsiders, but they don't have a medium to protect the customers and their data from each other.</p>

			<p>The need for encryption mainly depends on the working of the security systems and the basic need for encryption is to restrict the disclosure of sensitive data or programs to unauthorized access.</p>

				<h2 id="developer-piracy">For all developers - how to protect your software from piracy?</h2>
			</header>

			<h3>Get a sturdy software licensing service</h3>

			<p>You suddenly have a brainwave and get an idea for brand new software. It could be the next iOS or even Facebook! Have you ever been worried that someone might steal the software or the code from you? Or worse still they might make pirated copies of the same and distribute them for free. This could turn out to be every developer's nightmare. That is where software licensing steps in. This not only helps prevent intellectual property theft but even helps developers track the performance of the software and find out how it's doing. So the big question is how to implement software licensing.</p>

			<h3>Why and how to protect your software from piracy?</h3>

			<p>Learning how to protect your software from piracy can be essential and even crucial so that you do not see the next person using your software for free! Here are a couple of other reasons why you should protect it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Helps end users stay compliant</strong><br>
				By getting a software protection license you force users to stay compliant and not use pirated software. This helps them become more vigilant and enforces the use of only licensed software.
				<li><strong>You have the flexibility in monetization</strong><br>
				The developers can easily use this licensing software to define the amount they want to charges their end users. This can be made flexible easily as the factors for the price of the software could be dependent on currency, demographics, etc.
				<li><strong>Helps create new SaaS-based platforms</strong><br>
				Since developers would like to have complete control in the software licensing process, there are several SaaS-based on the rise to help them do this. They can manage their own software licenses and even track their performance. A SaaS-platform is basically 'software as a service' and allows the end user to manage a process or application with little or no technical know-how. For a developer learning how to protect your software from copying is just as important as managing it.
				<li><strong>Improves profits detection</strong><br>
				Since most of this licensing software is SaaS, developers can now not just learn how to track their software's performance or how to implement software licensing, but they can even identify areas in which they can improve on and even gain more profits from.
			</ul>

			<h3>Software protection services:</h3>

			<p>There a couple of things you need to ask yourself before you wonder how to license your software:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are the security parameters you looking for in your license?</li>
				<li>How much are you willing to pay?</li>
				<li>What are the different types of software protection service?</li>
			</ul>

			<p>One of the ways to know how to protect your software from piracy is to try the licensed computer services that protects ones software. This one that has gained a lot of ground over the past few years and is the most common type used by most developers. Users basically log in to a licensed computer which contains the software and access it. It is also known as node-locking.</p>

				<h2 id="save-money">How to Implement Software licensing and Save Money in the Process?</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Many think hard on <strong>how to implement software licensing</strong> but often end up spending a whole of money only to repent later. In today's smart world, it is important to do things the smart way. So, here we mention few great money saving tips on how to manage software licenses.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first thing that you should think of is paying for what you use. For this you should make a switch from per installation charge format to floating license based charges. This way you are charged as per the usage made at that time.</li>
				<li>Don't blindly go for peak usage; rather understand that average usage is always on the lower side compared to peak usage. So go for a bulk licensing agreement that is based on total number of average users received per month.</li>
				<li>Don't just ask -what is software licensing or look for its definition; try to understand things better because you should get a software license or you would need approval for installing software. This will keep those users away from the software who don't need them.</li>
				<li>Don't go for installing applications both on user's office PC and home laptops or mobile devices. Instead allow them to access their office PC remotely and get the software installed only on office PC.</li>
				<li>Look for open source, free but reliable software if they are compatible with your licensed applications. Don't blindly buy a software without doing a thorough research. You may or may not get such a software but don't stop yourself from searching for one.</li>
				<li>Understand that there is different version of software licenses running in an organization. Consider upgrading everyone to the same level through one single operating system if possible. This dramatically simplifies software management and even license management in most cases.</li>
				<li>Cut down on the number of different software tools that are being used by your organization. Fewer applications used by an organization is always advantageous as it simplifies software support, cuts down the total number of licenses and can also allow for bigger discounts for the other tools remaining. Above all, it almost eliminates the high charges that an organization pays for specialized tools that are used by just handful of people in an organization.</li>
				<li>If the users make use of both licensed software and open source tools, then cut down on the number of licensed software and make the open source tools standard as far as possible.</li>
				<li>Set the option wherein the users have to take administrative rights before installing any software on a corporate PC. Don't allow the users to download and install whatever they choose because trail versions and freeware of any software may not always be licensed for commercial purposes.</li>
				<li>If you know a thing or two about how software licensing works then you must have heard of SaaS or software as a service. Use SaaS licenses for offering all the software services through one single website. Then all the SaaS based licenses should be consolidated into one SaaS license agreement with one bulk discount.</li>
			</ul>

				<h2 id="piracy-tips">4 Easy Tips to Protect Your Software from Piracy.</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Securing software completely is almost next to impossible. There can be nothing done to protect your software from being copied and the chances are high that it could be distributed illegally, without any authorization from your end. This kind of malpractice can take place in any part of the world and you may even get to know about it. So, the best you can do to protect your software is to make your program difficult to copy and make it illegal for software pirates to make unauthorized soft copies or printed copies. What you could do in this regard, is make the terms clear in the disclaimer in a way that it is close to impossible for people to circumvent those conditions.</p>

			<h3>Here are a few important steps to keep in mind for securing your software:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Program Code Must be Copyrighted:</strong> Copyright is just a simple statement inserted in all the crucial parts of the code that states that the copyright owner alone is authorized to make copies of the software and that if there anyone finds the need to copy, they must first obtain permission of the copyrights owner. And this is the only legal way for making copies. Claiming copyright ownership of your software is fairly simple; all you need to do is add a copyright statement in each significant portion of the program code. You could insert a copyright statement in a Java code by adding it in the definition of the Java class. Don't forget to add the copyright symbol '©' before the statement.</li>
				<li><strong>Create a Strict License Agreement:</strong> This is fairly easy to do. First make a list of do's and don'ts for others to do with your code. Once this is done. Get a few samples of licence agreements of other soft wares, preferably ones that are similar to yours and read through them thoroughly.. A lot of these licence agreements can be confusing, un-intelligible and even silly. It must be to the point, thorough and easy to understand. Like most soft wares, allow the installation of the program to run only when the user is agree-able to the licence agreement. This could mean that the user can be legally sued therefore protecting your software from copying.</li>
				<li><strong>Code Obfuscation:</strong> Code obfuscation, in simple words, means making your program tough to decompile. Also try to make the decompiled code tough to understand. This method includes renaming the methods, objects and variables with random symbols; changing and re-arranging the code in a way that it runs perfectly but is tough to understand. There is an automatic part of the building process that helps you in performing the obfuscation task.</li>
				<li><strong>Let the users have a trial version first:</strong> This is one of the best ways to almost completely secure your software. You can initially provide a trial version where most of the important functionalities are disabled. After a certain period, if the user registers by paying you the licensing amount, make the rest of the software functionalities available to him/her only after that.</li>
			</ol> 


			<p>The methods listed above are all cost free but if you want to secure your software even more, you can register your software with the US copyright Office, get a lawyer to raft your licence and purchase advanced obfuscation programs.</p>

				<h2 id="three-aspects">3 Aspects of Licenses to Understand for Protecting Your Software.</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Many users who deal with small or medium sized software on a day to day basis often ask -what is software licensing! These licenses are nothing but a form of legal agreement that are concerned with distribution or use of a computer's software. Apart from those materials that are usually seen in the public domain, all others are copyright protected. Licensing the software is the most effective answer for people searching for solutions about how to protect your software from piracy. Licensing protects a software program from duplication, distribution or illegal sale by unauthorized bodies.</p>

			<h3>How to Protect Your Software from being Copied</h3>

			<p>With the formation of a confidential contract license protection can also be done. This might sound a bit tricky but this type of contract does protect the software from copying. What happens is through a secret contract users get the liberty to use the software in more than one ways despite being on the other side of the law. The initial copyright laws may not allow this after a private contract certain liberty can be achieved. That being said, it still continues to be against piracy and illegal duplication.</p>

			<h3>3 Aspects of Licenses That Describes How Software Licensing Works</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Knowing the Expiry Time of the Software:</strong> Anyone who uses a software must know about its expiry date. You can see the licenses information to check these details. This information tells you about the date when the software would fully or partially get expired. If it is partial expiry you would also learn about which features will expire on which date.</li>
				<li><strong>Consequences Post Expiry:</strong> When it comes to knowing all about how software licensing works one should also know the results or consequences of license expiry. Usually, before a software expires it shows a warning message at least 90 days in advance. After seeing this message it is important that the user takes necessary step and makes the arrangement for continued usage of the software. Usually even after the 90 days pass and the user doesn't make any arrangement he or she gets a certain grace period to do the necessary; though this may not be the case all the time. After the grace period the software stops functioning and then the user either has to stop using it or is forced to take action.</li>
				<li><strong>Transferring the License:</strong> Organizations usually maintain a native database in which all the details of the licenses are maintained. So when it comes to transferring the license from one system to another, all they do is shift the database file to the new system along with the license details. The serial numbers also move to the new system in the process.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Software license agreements are the first way of protection for the developers for protecting their software from being stolen or pirated. Many concerned developers go for more than one security option to safeguard their software from piracy, and thats totally up to you!</p>

				<h2 id="data-encryption">Ever wondered what is data encryption and how does it work?</h2>
			</header>

			<h3>So lets break it down for you.</h3>

			<p>When you send information via an electronic means, i.e. using the internet, the data is often encrypted to protect your privacy and keep it all secure. The changing of your data and information into algorithms or code makes it unreadable unless it reaches the destination it was aiming towards. This process of making your data unreadable it called data encryption. Initially, information encryption was utilized for exchanging government and military data electronically. Over the long haul as people in general has started to enter and transmit particular, delicate data over the web, information encryption has come to be more broad. These days web programs will immediately scramble content when associating with a protected server. A good way to know how to protect your data is to check when the URL has an S in the end which stands for Secure. For e.g. "https", which then reads - Hypertext Transmission Protocol, Secure.</p>

			<h3>What would count as sensitive or private data?</h3>

			<p>Sensitive data could be of all kinds and different data could be sensitive for different reasons. There are a couple of things though that you must never share if the page is not a secure page for e.g.:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Social Security Number</li>
				<li>Bank account information</li>
				<li>Financial or money related information</li>
				<li>Drivers license number, home phone number, date of birth</li>
				<li>Credit card and debit card numbers</li>
				<li>CVV or CVV@ number</li>
				<li>Usernames and passwords</li>
			</ul>

			<p>These are just a few to keep in mind while wondering about how can data be protected.</p>

			<h3>How to protect your data?</h3>

			<p>When sharing your data there are a couple of things you should check for:</p>
			<ol>
			    <li>Keep a copy of the information you send offline, in a different folder or even in a different drive.</li>
			    <li>Never open attachments without checking who the email is from. If its from an unknown source it is most likely a phishing email, malware, spyware or worst case scenario it could be a virus.</li>
			    <li>Always perform a scan on USB devices, CDs or DVDs you use on your computer.</li>
			    <li>Never store your passwords on your computer or even on your phone.</li>
			    <li>Never store any bank account information or other sensitive financial information.</li>
			    <li>Get a good anti-virus, malware and spyware detector.</li>
			    <li>Make sure you use only licensed software.</li>
			    <li>Check and scan your hard disk regularly.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Now that you know how data can be protected, you are the only one who can protect it.</p>

			<h3>Awareness is key</h3>

			<p>Data encryption has become so common that often we don't even realize it but we see it every day around us. For e.g. the local newspaper crossword could be considered a type of encryption of data also. Most email servers even offer encryption services which scramble you information when sending it out. This is done so no third-party can gain access to the information exchange. Most banking and shopping websites offer data encryption too. So now you wont find yourself wondering? What is data encryption?</p>
